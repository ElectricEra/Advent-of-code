This task is mostly about data parsing. As soon as you present it in a comfortable way, the rest is simple, because the logic of "moving" boxes is really straightforward.

To parse data, split taks into 2 parts - boxes and commands.

Boxes are kind of an upside-down for a computer logic, so reverse rows. Now it has first row that indicates amount of piles of boxes. Extract numbers and iterate over the rest of box rows and extract letters.

Commands - just extract 3 number values. Words are not needed.

## Taks 1
Add reverse to spliced array

## Task 2
No reverse needed
