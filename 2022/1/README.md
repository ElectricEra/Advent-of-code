## Task 1
This is just a simple sum and finding of max value.



## Task 2
First part is similar, sum of values.

To get top 3 values, used sorting, but there could've been a more optimized solution:
 - Iterate over all sums and dynamically manage top 3 sums. When new one enters array of 3 elements, last one leaves.
 - In the end - just sum.
